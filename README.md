This is a sample project I have been working on to demonstrate my abilities with React and Redux. It's a work in progress, but you can see some of the planned features below.

#### Planned Features
- add new recipes
- edit existing recipes
- ability to favorite a recipe
- filter recipes in sidebar with search input
- add recipe categories and make it filterable

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and can be run locally with the following commands.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run db`
3. `npm start`
